# Real-time-detection-of-Traffic-sign-and-signals
This project aims to identify Traffic signs and signals in real-time. This would be useful in an autonomous vehicle application. Technology and framework used: Opencv, Yolov3, and Darknet.

### Detect objects in both images and video streams using Deep Learning, OpenCV, and Python.

Iâ€™ll be using YOLOv3 in this project.

DataSets containing:-
(Signs)
-Stop
-SpeedLimit 40
-Forward
-Turn Left
-Turn Right

(Signals)
-Red signal
-green Signal
-Yellow Signal


## Installation

- `pip install numpy`
- `pip install opencv-python`
- 
- ## To Run the project
  If you run project Sign just go through the Traffic_sign folder and run yolo-3-camera.
  If you run project Signals just go through the Traffic_signal folder and run yolo-3-camera.
